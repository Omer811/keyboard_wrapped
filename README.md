# Keyboard Wrapped (cube story branch)

Keyboard Wrapped is a professional mockup for presenting a full-year, AI-enhanced keyboard story. The UI layers cubes that summarize performance, wordplay, and rhythm; the prompt and the resulting GPT insight are the only moving parts, so the experience stays polished and focused.

## Visual story

- **Cube Stories:** a calm, premium hero invites you to scroll vertically through curated sections.
- **Story Feed:** GPT-powered insight cards that spell out your keyboard age, persona, tempo, standout days, and vocabulary story.
- **Overview Pulse:** totals and the live balance between letters, actions, and pauses.
- **Key Flow:** a bar chart of your top keys matched with a 30-day pressure line.
- **Word Choreography:** a doughnut showing your favorite words with cinematic gradients.
- **Word Transitions:** a list of the most frequent word hops.
- **Pressure Profile:** your average hold mapped to a light/heavy slider with a subtle percentage indicator.
- **Layout Lab:** a keyboard grid that keeps modifiers in place while safely reflowing letters and highlighting the neighbors you visit most.
- **Word Heatmap:** luminous bubbles whose colors map frequency and diversity; clicking one draws its flow so you can read the cadence.

Every cube is controlled through `config/app.json`, so you can rearrange them, flip between datasets, and refresh the GPT narration without touching the UI code.
